Variables in Python

Varible is like your container where you will be able to store some information.
Eg age = 25
name = "Sudharshan Nayak"
EXAMPLE 
Start with a letter or underscore: Variable names must begin with a letter or an underscore.
Use letters, numbers, and underscores: You can include letters, numbers, and underscores in your variable name, but not at the start.
No spaces allowed: Use underscores if you need to separate words.
Case-sensitive: age and Age are different variables.
