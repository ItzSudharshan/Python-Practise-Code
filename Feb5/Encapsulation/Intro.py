'''

Encapsulation in programming is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It restricts direct access to some of the object's components, which means the internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside. This is done to protect the data from accidental changes and to manage complexity by providing a simple interface to interact with the data.

ACCESS MODIFIERS/ SPECIFIERS 

There are 3 Access Modifiers in Python which are 

Public -> by Default python variables are public 
private -> __variable_name (two underscore)
Protected -> _variable_name(one underscore)


Public : It should be accessed inside the class, outside the class 

Protected: It should be accessed inside the same class in which we have declared and inside child class 

Private: It should be accessed inside the same class in which we have declared

USE :
To determine the accessibilty of data memembers and member functions '''
