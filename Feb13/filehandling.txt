File handling in Python allows you to store, retrieve, and modify data outside of your program, similar to writing in a diary. This helps in saving information permanently for future access.

Opening: Like opening a book.
Reading: Like reading the contents.
Writing: Like adding new entries.
Closing: Like closing the book.
Key Points
Opening a File: Use open() with modes ('r', 'w', 'a', 'r+').
Reading a File: Use read(), readline(), or readlines().
Writing to a File: Use 'w' mode with write(), but it overwrites everything.
Appending to a File: Use 'a' mode to add data without losing the existing content.
Closing a File: Always close your files to free up resources. Using the with statement helps you do this automatically.
