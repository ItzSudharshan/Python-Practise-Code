List comprehension is a simple way to create lists. Instead of writing multiple lines of code with loops to add items to a list, list comprehensions let you do it all in one line. This makes your code easier to read and reduces the chances of making mistakes. Itâ€™s a shortcut that saves time and makes your code look cleaner.

Example :
Syntax:
[expression for item in iterable]


Without List Comprehension:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
doubled = []
for num in numbers:
    doubled.append(num * 2)
print(doubled)

Output : -> [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]


With List Comprehension:
doubled = [num * 2 for num in numbers]
print(doubled)
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]


Example: Filtering Even Numbers
even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
print(even_numbers)

Output : -> [2, 4]
